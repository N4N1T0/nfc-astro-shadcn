### One-Day-a-Week Full-Body Training Schedule

This training program consists of a one-day-a-week full-body workout routine. Each session includes one exercise from each of the following categories: Squat, Hip Hinge, Push, and Pull. The workout is structured into 4 rounds of 10-12 repetitions per exercise, with varying levels of intensity based on the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE).

### Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE)
Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) is a subjective measure used to gauge the intensity of your exercise. It's typically assessed on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being very easy and 10 being maximum effort. Using RPE can help you adjust your workout intensity based on how you're feeling on a given day, ensuring you're working at an appropriate level for your goals and capabilities.

**Weekly Rotation:**
- Each week, the categories are rotated, starting with the second category from the previous week. This rotation ensures balanced muscle development and prevents monotony in the training routine.

### Exercise Selection for Each Round:
- **Round 1 (RPE 9)**: Choose one exercise from one category that challenges you close to your maximum effort.
- **Round 2 (RPE 7)**: Select exercises that still provide a challenge but allow for slightly more comfort and control *from the next category*.
- **Round 3 (RPE 5)**: Opt for exercises that you can perform with moderate effort, focusing on form and technique *from the next category*.
- **Round 4 (RPE 3)**: Choose exercises that are relatively easy and serve as a cooldown, promoting recovery *from the next category*.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively target all major muscle groups, progressively overload your muscles, and achieve balanced strength and fitness improvements over time.
