## General Knowledge ##

Welcome back to an exclusive sneak peek into my upcoming strength and conditioning program, meticulously crafted for boxers and fitness enthusiasts alike! in this part 2 of the first week of the program we will continue with the same aproach but with a little twist. 

### Weekly Workout Schema ###

- 6 Days Training (3 High Int - 2 Moderate Int - 1 Low Int)
- 2-3 Sessions of Strength & Conditioning Training (Condensed Conjugated Method)
- 2-3 Sessions of Boxing Training (You can use your current boxing workout if you like)
- 1 Session of Cardio/Active Recovery

## The APS ##

 - <strong>AMRAP</strong>: Stands for "As Many Rounds (or Repetitions) As Possible." In fitness routines, particularly during circuit or time-based workouts, AMRAP indicates that the individual should perform as many rounds or repetitions of a given set of exercises within a specified time frame. It encourages participants to push their limits and maximize their effort during the allotted time.

- <strong>AHAP</strong>: Stands for "As Heavy As Possible." This term is commonly used in strength training to emphasize lifting the heaviest weight that an individual can manage with proper form. AHAP encourages individuals to challenge themselves and progressively increase the load to promote strength gains over time.

- <strong>AFAP</strong>: Stands for "As Fast As Possible." In workout contexts, AFAP instructs individuals to complete a set of exercises or a particular movement pattern as quickly as they can while maintaining proper form. It's often used as a directive in high-intensity training to enhance cardiovascular endurance and overall speed.
