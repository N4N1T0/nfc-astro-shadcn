In 2019, Volkanovski clinched his first championship victory by narrowly defeating Max Holloway at UFC 245. Despite a close contest, Volkanovski secured a unanimous decision. Undeterred, he faced Holloway again seven months later and emerged victorious once more.

Subsequently, Volkanovski defended his title successfully five times, overcoming challenges from Brian Ortega, "The Korean Zombie," Holloway in a third encounter, and Rodriguez. Although he fell two defenses short of Jose Aldo's featherweight record, Volkanovski now boasts an impressive 11-fight win streak in the UFC featherweight division. This streak is the longest active run in the division and the second-longest in history, trailing only Max Holloway's 13-fight streak.

Despite Volkanovski's impressive striking record, uncertainties linger among fans about how it will fare against Topuria at UFC 298. Commencing his professional mixed martial arts journey with seven consecutive submission victories, six of which occurred in the first round, Topuria has evolved into a formidable presence on the feet as his career has advanced.

In March 2022, Topuria stepped up a weight class to face England's Jai Herbert, who possessed significant height and reach advantages. Overcoming early challenges, Topuria sealed the bout with a sensational knockout just one minute into the second round.

In his most recent showdown, Topuria showcased his striking prowess against Josh Emmett in his inaugural UFC main event. Although he didn't secure a finish, his outstanding performance earned him the Fight of the Night accolade, positioning him as the next contender for the championship belt.

### Conclusion ###

In the UFC 298 main event, a striking contrast is evident between Volkanovski and Topuria. Volkanovski boasts an advantage in volume and accuracy, while Topuria holds the power advantage. The champion impressively lands 6.19 strikes per minute, nearly double the UFC average, but registers only 0.37 knockdowns per 15 minutes. On the other hand, Topuria delivers 4.44 strikes per minute and secures 0.97 knockdowns over three rounds.

In battles between durable fighters, volume often prevails, particularly in championship rounds. However, the intriguing question arises: How frequently will Topuria's power test Volkanovski's durability? The clash of styles promises an exciting narrative in this anticipated UFC 298 matchup.
