## General Knowledge ##

Welcome to an exclusive sneak peek into my upcoming strength and conditioning program, meticulously crafted for boxers and fitness enthusiasts alike! Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to infuse boxing into your routine, this program is designed with you in mind. 

### Weekly Workout Schema ###

- 6 Days Training (3 High Int - 2 Moderate Int - 1 Low Int)
- 2-3 Sessions of Strength & Conditioning Training (Condensed Conjugated Method)
- 2-3 Sessions of Boxing Training (You can use your current boxing workout if you like)
- 1 Session of Cardio/Active Recovery

## Introduction to Condensed Conjugated Method ##

The Condensed Conjugate Method, introduced by renowned powerlifting coach <a href='https://joshstrength.com/' target='_blank' class='text-white'>Josh Bryant</a>, seamlessly integrates components from both the Conjugate Method and high-frequency training principles. Its primary objective is to maximize strength and power gains by concurrently enhancing diverse physical qualities. Diverging from the conventional Conjugate Method, this approach adopts shorter training cycles, typically spanning 2-4 weeks and occurring 2-3 times a week. This aspect holds particular significance for boxers, as it allows ample space for skill training and conditioning sessions alongside strength development.
